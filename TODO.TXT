User Model Integration Steps:
Define Custom User Models:

Create custom user models that represent students and employees in your application. These models will interact with the existing tbl_student and tbl_employees tables.
User Model Configuration:

Define the necessary fields in the custom user models to match the columns in the tbl_student and tbl_employees tables, such as username, email, password hash, and any additional fields required for authentication and authorization.
User Datastore Setup:

Create a custom user datastore that interacts with the existing tables (tbl_student and tbl_employees) to manage user data, roles, and permissions. This datastore will be used by Flask-Security for user management.
Flask-Security Integration:

Configure Flask-Security to work with the custom user models and user datastores. Initialize Flask-Security with the custom user datastores and user models in your Flask application.
Role Definitions:

Define roles for students and employees within Flask-Security using the RoleMixin class. Assign roles and permissions as needed for each user type.
Authentication and Authorization:

Implement authentication and authorization logic using Flask-Security decorators and methods to protect routes and resources based on user roles.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Utilize Flask-Security's role-based access control features to restrict access to specific routes or resources based on the roles assigned to students and employees.
Testing and Validation:

Test the authentication and authorization flow to ensure that users (students and employees) can authenticate successfully and access resources based on their roles.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implement error handling mechanisms and logging to track authentication and authorization-related issues for debugging and monitoring purposes.
